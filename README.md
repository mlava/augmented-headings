Add H4, H5 and H6 headings to your Roam Research graph!

With this extension, you can create H4-H6 headings and control their CSS very easily. Simply install the extension and then modify the settings in Roam Depot. Note that if you don't change the font settings in Roam Depot settings you won't see any change in the text output even if you make that block a heading. You **must** set font settings to see any difference.

**New:**
- Now compatible with the new user-defined hotkeys function - see Hotkeys option in Roam Research Settings
- added setting to allow user-configured heading tags. If you don't want #h4 you could use #.h4 or even #purple_elephant for that heading tag, and the extension will handle it.

The new headings even work with my Sticky Headings and Table of Contents extension as well!

For each heading level you can configure:
- font size
- font weight
- font style
- font variant

You can set a heading using the Command Palette. Click into a block and then select 'Toggle Heading - H4', 'Toggle Heading - H5' or 'Toggle Heading - H6'. 
Or, right click on the block bullet, go to Plugins and then select the Toggle commands from there.

If your heading is H4 and you click to toggle H4, it will return to normal text. This is how Roam handles H1-H3. However, if you toggle to a different heading level (e.g. H4 -> H5) it will overwrite to the new level. Again, this is how Roam handles this case.

TODO:
1. ~~Enhance Sticky Headings extension to respect these new heading levels H4-H6~~
2. ~~Enhance Table of Contents extension to respect these new heading levels H4-H6~~
