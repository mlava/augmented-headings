Add H4, H5 and H6 headings to your Roam Research graph!

With this extension, you can create H4-H6 headings and control their CSS very easily. Simply install the extension and then modify the settings in Roam Depot.

For each heading level you can configure:
- font size
- font weight
- font style
- font variant

You can set a heading using the Command Palette. Click into a block and then select 'Toggle Heading - H4', 'Toggle Heading - H5' or 'Toggle Heading - H6'. 
Or, right click on the block bullet, go to Plugins and then select the Toggle commands from there.

If your heading is H4 and you click to toggle H4, it will return to normal text. This is how Roam handles H1-H3. However, if you toggle to a different heading level (e.g. H4 -> H5) it will overwrite to the new level. Again, this is how Roam handles this case.
